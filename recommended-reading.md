1. Otto et al. [The origins and potential future.... ](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(21)00878-2.pdf).
Good integration of molecular biology and population modelling to characterize selection pressure.

2. Plowright et al. 2024. [Ecological countermeasures to prevent...](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46151-9). A nice description of environment and ecological considerations for zoonotic spillover.

3. Day et al. 2006. [The evolutionary emergence of pandemic influenza](https://mast.queensu.ca/~tday/pdf/DayAndrePark2006.pdf). Good modelling framework.

4. Ogden et al. [Emerging infectious disease and biological invasions](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.181577). Good description of parallels between biological invasions and emergining infectious diseases.

5. Iacono et al. [A unified framework for the infection dynamics...](https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0004957). A nice framework, similar to Day et al. 2006 but with more effort to parameterize for biological data.

6. Lloyd-Smith et al. [Nine challenges...](10.1016/j.epidem.2014.09.002) Good description of where contributions are needed.
7. Baker et al. [Infectious disease in an era of global change](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-021-00639-z). Data rich, and good description of the issues.
8. Hurford et al. [Pandemic preparedness for regions...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519322003691). Framework is similar to Day et al. 2006/Iacono et al., but there are aspects of immunity, travel measures, and community NPIs that impact spillover risk.
9. Martignoni et al. 2024. [Is SARS-CoV-2 elimination or mitigation best?](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.240186). This really to do with if the infection is spreading in the community or not. Since a new influenza strain hasn't spilled over to human, the approach should be elimination, but this whole discussion gets confused due to not properly defining the temporal stages in disease establishment and because of poor delination of the spatial scale.
